I am a young researcher in the field of ecological sciences. I hold a bachelor's degree in the field of Forestry and currently pursuing a master's degree in the field of Ecology with a major in ecology and conservation. My research aims to utilize advanced techniques and technologies to explore how ecological restoration and the management of natural resources can be facilitated. My long-term career goals are to become a professor in the field of natural resources management as well as an advocate of ecological restoration, facilitating various ecological processes in the world at large. I am proud to have developed a creative, collaborative, and open-minded career and invite you to learn more about my previous work and ongoing research project.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons. 

Example: editing a markdown file for a talk
