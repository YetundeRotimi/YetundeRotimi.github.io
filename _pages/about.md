I am a young researcher in the field of ecological sciences. I hold a bachelor's degree in the field of Forestry and currently pursuing a master's degree in the field of Ecology with a major in ecology and conservation. My research aims to utilize advanced techniques and technologies to explore how ecological restoration and the management of natural resources can be facilitated. My long-term career goals are to become a professor in the field of natural resources management as well as an advocate of ecological restoration, facilitating various ecological processes in the world at large. I am proud to have developed a creative, collaborative, and open-minded career and invite you to learn more about my previous work and ongoing research project.
